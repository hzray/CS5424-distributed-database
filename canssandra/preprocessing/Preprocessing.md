# Preprocessing

Preprocessing of the data file including the following tasks

- Impute missing data into standard format
  - specific for cassandra because cassandra does not support NULL keyword 

- Create new data table `customer_order_items`

- Create new data table `customer_order`



## Imputing 

- Impute missing integer value to `-1`
  - those table have missing integer values including
    - `orders.o_carrier_id`
- Impute missing text value to `unknown`
  - those table have missing string values including
    - `customer.c_state`
- Impute missing timestamp value to `1970-01-01 00:00:00`
  - those table have missing timestamp values including
    - `order_line.ol_delivery_d`



## customer_order_items

This table has fields

- `coi_w_id` 	
- `coi_d_id`
- `coi_c_id`
- `coi_o_id`
- `coi_i_id`



`customer_order_items` is created by joining `order_line` , ` order` and `customer`, in the provided `order_line` table there is no customer-id provided, this table will help to process the related_customer transaction.



## customer_order

This table has fields

- `co_w_id`
- `co_d_id`
- `co_c_id`
- `co_o_id`
- `co_i_ids`

`customer_order` can be viewed as a grouped version of `customer_order_items` where items from the same order are grouped together. `co_i_ids` store a list of item-ids of a specific order.



####  How these two tables help process Related_Customer?

Normally, if we use brutal force to find related customers of customer A, we would 

~~~cassandra
	1. looking into all orders of customer A, and find what items are in the order.
  2. for each order OA of customer A,
			for each warehouse:
				for each district:
					for each customer B:
						for each customer's order OB:
              check if OA and OB has more than 2 items in common, if so A and B are related customer
~~~

The step 2 can be inefficient and time consuming if we mereply reply on programming language to check if OA and OB has common items.                
               
The table `customer_order` help to simplify step 1, so we can easily retrieve all orders of a customer, and items in each order (in a list format)


The table `customer_order_items` help to improve step 2:

~~~cassandra
for each order OA of customer A
	for each warehoue w :
		for each district d:
			select * from customer_order_items where w_id=w and d_id=d and i_id in (OA.items)
			keep these rows whose order number appear more than once ...	
      customers associated with these order numbers are related customers to A  
~~~



The database keyword `in` can help us to get better performance.
To maintain these two tables, we need to update them when processing NewOrder Transaction.
